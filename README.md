# GitHub
GitHub is the largest and most advanced development platform in the world. Millions of developers and companies build, ship, and maintain their software on GitHub.

## What is a repository ?
A repository is the most basic element of GitHub. They're easiest to imagine as a project's folder. A repository contains all of the project files (including documentation), and stores each file's revision history. Repositories can have multiple collaborators and can be either public or private. You can discuss and manage your project's work within a repository. Check out the documentation to know how to create a repostory :
